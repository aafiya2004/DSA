This is a basic implementation of basic Object Oriented Programming concepts.
The functionalities of Library Management System include:
1) Adding a book to the library
2) Displaying all the books
3) Issuing a book to a customer
4) Returning a book
   
Through this project, I practiced and understood the following core OOP concepts in Java:
1) Classes and objects
2) Encapsulation for data hiding
3) Constructors for Object initialization
4)  Dynamic object handling using ArrayList
5)  Menu-driven program structure
6)  Separation of classes (modular class design)
7) Input handling using Scanner

This project was built purely using core Java without any frameworks, focusing entirely on strengthening my object-oriented thinking.
It reflects my understanding of clean code, modular design, and foundational Java programming.
